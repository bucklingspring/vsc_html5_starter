## Visual Studio Code HTML5 Starter
 
This extension provides the standard HTML5 starter code used in all web applications, based off of [sidthesloth's popular extension](https://github.com/sidthesloth92/vsc_html5_boilerplate) and modified for my own usage.

I will be accepting no pull requests or issues. However, I HIGHLY encourage you to support the original [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/sidthesloth92/vsc_html5_boilerplate) project if you'd like to make contributions.
